I am a Full Professor in School of Computer Science and Engineering at Beihang University. I received my Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from the University of Ottawa in 2011. Before that, I received my M.S. degree and B.S. degree in Computer Science from Jilin University.

My research interests include natural language processing (e.g., large language model, low-resource NLP and text representation learning) and knowledge graph (e.g., knowledge graph question answering, link prediction and entity alignment).
